that for every two vertices in C there exists an edge connecting the two.

Coloring
========

Graph coloring is the problem of assigning a color to the vertices of a graph in
a way that no adjacent vertices have the same color.

Example
-------

The map-coloring problem is to assign a color to each region of a map
(represented by a vertex on a graph) such that any two regions sharing a border
(represented by an edge of the graph) have different colors.

.. _dnx_cover:

Cover
=====

Vertex covering is the problem of finding a set of vertices such that all the
edges of the graph are incident to at least one of the vertices in the set.

    (the horizontal tile of the Chimera unit cell) and the red set (vertical
    tile) connect to all 16 edges of the graph.

.. _dnx_elimination_ordering:

Elimination Ordering
====================

Many algorithms for NP-hard problems are exponential in treewidth. However,
finding a lower bound on treewidth is in itself NP-complete. [Gog2004]_
describes a branch-and-bound algorithm for computing the treewidth of an
undirected graph by searching in the space of *perfect elimination ordering* of
vertices of the graph.

A *clique* of a graph is a fully-connected subset of vertices; that is, every
pair of vertices in the clique share an edge. A *simplicial* vertex is one
whose neighborhood induces a clique. A perfect elimination ordering is an
ordering of vertices :math:`1..n` such that any vertex :math:`i` is simplicial
for the subset of vertices :math:`i..n`.

Maximum Cut
===========

A maximum cut is a subset of a graph's vertices such that the number of edges
between this subset and the remaining vertices is as large as possible.

.. figure:: ../_images/MaxCut.png
    :name: Cut
    :alt: image
    :align: center
    :scale: 60 %

    Maximum cut for a Chimera unit cell: the blue line around the subset of
    nodes {4, 5, 6, 7} cuts 16 edges; adding or removing a node decreases the
    number of edges between the two complementary subsets of the graph.

Independent Set
===============

An independent set is a set of a graph's vertices with no edge connecting any of
its member pairs.

    Independent sets for a Chimera unit cell: the nodes of both the blue set of
    vertices (the horizontal tile of the Chimera unit cell) and the red set
    (vertical tile) are independent sets of the graph, with no blue node
    adjacent to another blue node and likewise for red nodes.

Partitioning
============

A `k`-partition consists of `k` disjoint and equally sized subsets of a graph's
vertices such that the total number of edges between nodes in distinct subsets
is as small as possible.

    A 2-partition for a simple graph: the nodes in blue are in the '0' subset,
    and the nodes in red are in the '1' subset. There are no other arrangements
    with fewer edges between two equally sized subsets.

Social
======

A signed social network graph is a graph whose signed edges represent
friendly/hostile interactions between vertices.

    :scale: 80 %

    A signed social graph for three nodes, where Eve and Bob are friendly with
    each other and hostile to Alice. This network is balanced because it can be
    cleanly divided into two subsets, {Bob, Eve} and {Alice}, with friendly
    relations within each subset and only hostile relations between the subsets.
